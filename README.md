## Overview

Aethermon is a blockchain project developed as part of the "Blockchain and Ledger Technologies" course led by Professor Claudio di Ciccio. The primary objective of this project is to implement a blockchain that facilitates the exchange of AI-generated collectible icons, reminiscent of Pokemon. These icons, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), can be traded and purchased within a dedicated marketplace using a custom token. Additionally, Aethermon introduces the concept of missions, allowing NFTs to undergo unique challenges that modify their characteristics.

## Features

- **NFT Trading:** Users can buy, sell, and trade Aethermons within the blockchain network.
- **Custom Token:** A dedicated token is used for transactions within the Aethermon marketplace.
- **AI-Generated Icons:** Aethermons are unique and generated using artificial intelligence, adding diversity to the collection.
- **Missions:** Aethermons can participate in missions to enhance or modify their attributes, adding a dynamic element to the gameplay.
- **Decentralized:** Aethermon operates on a decentralized blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
